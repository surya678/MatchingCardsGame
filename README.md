# MatchingCardsGame

The UI design was custom-made to fit my preferences, with additional icons sourced and integrated into the scene

The game offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

Gameplay is simple: All cards are revealed for 2 seconds before flipping over. Players then take turns clicking to find matching pairs.

The game tracks the number of rounds and the total matches made by the player.

There are two key scripts: the Game Manager, responsible for handling all game functions, and the Card script, which manages individual card data and flip animations.
